Created a Foreign exchange rate service as SpringBoot-based microservice.

The exchange rates can be received from [2]. This is a public service provided by the German central bank.

As we are using user story format to specify our requirements, here are the user stories to implement:

As a client, I want to get a list of all available currencies
As a client, I want to get all EUR-FX exchange rates at all available dates as a collection
As a client, I want to get the EUR-FX exchange rate at particular day
As a client, I want to get a foreign exchange amount for a given currency converted to EUR on a particular day
If you think that your service would require storage, please use H2 for simplicity, even if this would not be your choice if you would implement an endpoint for real clients.

We are looking out for the following aspects in your submission:

Well structured and thought-through api and endpoint design
Clean code
Application of best practices & design patterns
That being said it is not enough to "just make it work", show your full potential to write excellent software for Crewmeister !

Setup
Requirements
Java 11 (will run with OpenSDK 15 as well)
Maven 3.x
Project
The project was generated through the Spring initializer [1] for Java 11 with dev tools and Spring Web as dependencies. In order to build and run it, you just need to click the green arrow in the Application class in your Intellij CE IDE or run the following command from your project root und Linux or ios.

$ mvn spring-boot:run
After running, the project, switch to your browser and hit http://localhost:8080/api/currencies. You should see some demo output.
